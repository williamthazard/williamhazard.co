William Hazard makes poems with computers.
<br><br><br><br>
These poems involve [words](words/words.html).

They also involve [sounds](sounds/sounds.html).

These are interwoven with [code](code/code.html).

Sometimes, they're captured in [videos](videos/videos.html).

Sometimes, they're shared in [performances](performances/performances.html).

The rest of the time, there's a [log](log/log.html) [[rss](log/rss.xml)].
