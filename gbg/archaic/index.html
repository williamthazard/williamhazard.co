<br/><h1>ARCHAIC TORSO OF APOLLO</h1>
<h4>Rainer Maria Rilke</h4>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br />
We cannot know his legendary <a href="../1">head</a> <br />
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso <br />
is still suffused with brilliance from inside, <br />
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low, <br /></p>
<p>gleams in all its power. Otherwise <br />
the curved breast could not <a href="../3">dazzle</a> you so, nor could <br />
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs <br />
to that dark center where procreation flared. <br /></p>
<p>Otherwise this stone would seem defaced <br />
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders <br />
and would not <a href="../4">glisten</a> like a wild beastâ€™s fur: <br /></p>
<p>would not, from all the borders of itself, <br />
burst like a star: for here there is no place <br />
that does not see you. You must change your <a href="../2">life</a>.</p>
