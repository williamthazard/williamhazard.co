<br/><p>We cannot know his legendary <a href="../1">head</a>
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,</p>
<p>gleams in all its power. Otherwise
the curved breast could not <a href="../3">dazzle</a> you so, nor could
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
to that dark center where procreation flared.</p>
<p>Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
and would not <a href="../4">glisten</a> like a wild beastâ€™s fur:</p>
<p>would not, from all the borders of itself,
burst like a star: for here there is no place
that does not see you. You must change your <a href="../2">life</a>.</p>
