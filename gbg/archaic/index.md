# ARCHAIC TORSO OF APOLLO
#### Rainer Maria Rilke

We cannot know his legendary [head](../1) <br />
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso <br />
is still suffused with brilliance from inside, <br />
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low, <br />

gleams in all its power. Otherwise <br />
the curved breast could not [dazzle](../3) you so, nor could <br />
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs <br />
to that dark center where procreation flared. <br />

Otherwise this stone would seem defaced <br />
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders <br />
and would not [glisten](../4) like a wild beastâ€™s fur: <br />

would not, from all the borders of itself, <br />
burst like a star: for here there is no place <br />
that does not see you. You must change your [life](../2).
