We cannot know his legendary [head](../1)
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,

gleams in all its power. Otherwise
the curved breast could not [dazzle](../3) you so, nor could
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
to that dark center where procreation flared.

Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
and would not [glisten](../4) like a wild beastâ€™s fur:

would not, from all the borders of itself,
burst like a star: for here there is no place
that does not see you. You must change your [life](../2).
