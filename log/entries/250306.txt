[code sonnets]

you are cordially invite to join me for this online workshop on March
27th, 2025, presented in collaboration with A Writer’s Party, in which
we’ll be experimenting with what I’m calling “code sonnets” – 14-line
poems, with a turn at line 8, made of executable code. We’ll be focused
on making these in javascript using the p5.js library, but of course,
you’re welcome to use whatever you’d like. You can register for the
workshop at
https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/okYyxkWBQoao6txf_nNHGg#/registration,
and you can find some examples at
https://williamhazard.co/sketches/boom-red/ and
https://williamhazard.co/sketches/teapot/.

In the workshop, we’ll go over these examples together, and then you’ll
get some time to make something of your own and share it with the group.
You don’t have to download anything to participate – you can make pieces
just like those examples entirely in the browser, using the handy p5.js
code editor and reference, which I’ll introduce you to in the workshop.
I’m excited to explore these ideas together, and my hope is that they’ll
provide a fun and approachable introduction to creative coding for
newcomers and an interesting and inspiring challenge for everyone. I
hope you’ll join us.
