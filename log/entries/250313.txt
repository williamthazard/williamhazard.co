[code sonnet example number one]

two weeks from today, I’ll be leading a workshop on what I’m calling
“code sonnets” on zoom, as one part of A Writer’s Party, which is a
wonderful free alternative to the AWP conference both in-person here in
Philadelphia and online. The image above is a screenshot from one of the
examples I’ve cooked up for the workshop, but we’re going to make all
sorts of things with just 14 lines of code at a time. You can find a
link to register on the home page of my website. I hope you’ll join us.
