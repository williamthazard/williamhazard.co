<p>today, Bob asked me if I had any bananas. The answer was that I had six bananas, but they were brown and in the freezer. It is, perhaps, more relevant to readers of this log to know that I also have several copies of Bob's recent book, <em>Landscaper</em>, and they will be available for sale at Theatre of the Flat Imagination tomorrow.</p>
