this year, instead of having yet another thing “wrapped,” I made a point
of noticing whenever I woke up with a song already stuck in my head,
which I found happens to me pretty often, and adding that song to a
playlist. It’s sort of like a playlist dream journal. If you’d like to
get a sense of what was bopping around in my head this year, this
playlist will give you that sense
