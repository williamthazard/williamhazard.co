[Dave Cedillo](http://davidcedillo.com/) was kind enough to include a [track](https://soundcloud.com/user-246275786/was-that?si=4ce65c3a222d4d70a7b0019bd4e5a008&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) of mine in the most recent [episode](https://audioflaregun.com/2024/05/13/episode-three-not-howdy-doody-time/) of [Audio Flare Gun](https://audioflaregun.com/). The track is one that I put together while working on the [bwsampler](https://github.com/williamthazard/bwsampler) instrument during my residency at [The Bridge Way School](https://www.thebridgewayschool.org/). I'm feeling enormously grateful for those students and for the opportunity the school gave me to work with them.
