blurry process pic of me soldering a transducer for settle, a multimedia
installation created in collaboration with Alexandra Wood at
Philadelphia Small Works Gallery, opening tonight at 6pm. Thanks to
Souha Yan for helping me source these transducers. Thanks to dani derks
for helping me figure out the wiring. Thanks, also, to Zack Scholl,
whose blog post on multichannel audio in supercollider on linux was very
helpful, to Robbie Lyman for some last-minute code review, and to Ezra
Buchla for writing a lovely piano sound in supercollider that I modified
very slightly and repurposed for this piece.
