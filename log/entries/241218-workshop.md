[Warren Longmire](https://alongmirewriter.squarespace.com/) and I will be hosting another flat imagination workshop next month, this time at [The Perch Music & Arts Workshop at The Emerald Wildflower Garden](https://www.emeraldwildflowergarden.org/the-perch-music-arts-studio), a venue I fell in love with after playing a show there with [Sadie Dupuis](https://www.sadiedupuis.com/), [Chris Campanioni](https://chriscampanioni.com/), [olga mikolaivna](https://olgamikolaivna.wordpress.com/), [John Pinto](https://pintopintopinto.com/), [Ollie Becker](https://olliebecker.net/), [Edward Longo](https://sunkenbasilica.bandcamp.com/album/starflesh), [Orah Ruth](https://www.instagram.com/orahruth.mp3/), and [Mike Bagwell](https://www.mikebagwell.me/) to kick off Mike's new Ghost Harmonics performance series. 

This installment of the flat imagination workshop will include performances by [dani derks](https://dndrks.com/) and The Goodbye Mind as well as a beginner-friendly digital synthesis workshop using [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/), led by dani. The idea is "here's a cool thing I made; here's how I made it and how you can make it too." So if you're in Philadelphia or nearby, please [join us](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/-mix-lit-presents-a-flat-imagination-workshop-goodbye-mind-dani-derks-tickets-1116860623189?aff=oddtdtcreator) to see what cool things dani has made and then to see how they made them and how we can make them too!
