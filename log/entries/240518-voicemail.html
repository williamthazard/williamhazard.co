<p>got a new old thing up over at <a href="https://voicemailpoems.org/">voicemail poems</a>. The piece is titled <a href="https://voicemailpoems.org/2024/05/06/resentment-big-water/">&quot;Resentment: Big Water.&quot;</a> It's part of a series I was writing a couple years ago about things I felt resentful about, in which I was trying to use the work as a means through which to release that resentment, to free myself of it.</p>
<p>At the time, I had <a href="https://www.prolitmag.com/">prolit</a> in mind as a potential home for this, but as the piece developed, it started to veer away from what felt like prolit territory to me, and for a while, I just shelved it. A couple months ago, though, I was hanging out with <a href="https://www.amysaulzerby.com/">Amy Saul-Zerby</a> at Liner Notes (a wonderful reading series hosted by <a href="https://www.alinapleskova.com/">Alina Pleskova</a> at <a href="https://www.48recordbar.com/">48 Record Bar</a> here in Philly), and Amy and I got to talking about voicemail poems, and it just clicked with me that vmp was the right home for this piece. I sent it over to Amy, and she agreed, and now, here it is, out in the world. I hope you like it.</p>
