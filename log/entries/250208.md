blurry process pic of me soldering a transducer for _settle_, a multimedia installation created in collaboration with [Alexandra Wood](https://www.tender-form.com/) at [Philadelphia Small Works Gallery](https://www.philadelphiasmallworks.com/), opening tonight at 6pm. Thanks to [Souha Yan](https://memory-object.com) for helping me source these transducers. Thanks to [dani derks](https://dndrks.com) for helping me figure out the wiring. Thanks, also, to [Zack Scholl](https://infinitedigits.co), whose blog post on multichannel audio in supercollider on linux was very helpful, to [Robbie Lyman](https://alanza.xyz/) for some last-minute code review, and to [Ezra Buchla](https://catfact.bandcamp.com/album/no-mention) for writing a lovely piano sound in [supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) that I modified very slightly and repurposed for this piece.
