got a new old thing up over at [voicemail poems](https://voicemailpoems.org/). The piece is titled ["Resentment: Big Water."](https://voicemailpoems.org/2024/05/06/resentment-big-water/) It's part of a series I was writing a couple years ago about things I felt resentful about, in which I was trying to use the work as a means through which to release that resentment, to free myself of it. 

At the time, I had [prolit](https://www.prolitmag.com/) in mind as a potential home for this, but as the piece developed, it started to veer away from what felt like prolit territory to me, and for a while, I just shelved it. A couple months ago, though, I was hanging out with [Amy Saul-Zerby](https://www.amysaulzerby.com/) at Liner Notes (a wonderful reading series hosted by [Alina Pleskova](https://www.alinapleskova.com/) at [48 Record Bar](https://www.48recordbar.com/) here in Philly), and Amy and I got to talking about voicemail poems, and it just clicked with me that vmp was the right home for this piece. I sent it over to Amy, and she agreed, and now, here it is, out in the world. I hope you like it.
